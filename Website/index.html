    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Iris Currie. I am currently a third year student at Miami University studying Games and Simulations
      with a focus on game design and programming and Minoring in Computer Science. Before I was a Games & Simulations
      major I was also a theater major, mainly focusing on stage acting. I have been playing games my entire life, from
      board games with my family as a child, to my unending interest in every corner of the world of video games. I
      pride myself in being fairly well versed in almost every genre of games, be it an FPS, rogue-like, JRPG, rhythm
      game, you name a genre and I've probably played it. I currently am a member of the Miami University varsity Street
      Fighter 6 team, and spend most of my free time either playing or making video games.</p>
