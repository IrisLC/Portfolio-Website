    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>My name is Iris Currie. I am a third year Games + Simulations major focusing on Game development and programming,
      with a minor in Computer Science. I have grown up playing video games, and it has been a long time dream of mine
      to make them, but for many years that's all it was, a dream, as I spent most of my time focusing on theater and
      acting.
      But now that I have changed my focuses I am striving to make that old dream a reality, taking as
      many classes as I can to learn every facet of the game design industry, meanwhile taking what time I can to slowly
      work on a few personal projects of mine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I additionally spend my time at college participating in a few extracurriculars. Those being the Miami University
      Game Design Club, as well as being a member of the Miami University
      Varsity Street Fighter 6 team.</p>
