        <p>A concept for a game I am working on. A 2D rogue-like in which powerful upgrades throughout the run come with
          the sacrifice of limbs/body parts of the player character which in turn affects the game play in some way,
          resulting in every power up coming with a consequence. </p>
        <p>Currently all I have to show for the project is some pixel art concepts which use methods for toggleable
          damage to the character. (Shown left: Top: the player character. Bottom: player character with multiple
          damages triggered)</p>
