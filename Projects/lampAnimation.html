        <p>First foray into 3d animation. Was given a scene with objects, and tasked with creating an animation ~8-10
          seconds long, involving animating both the location of objects, as well as various other attributes (lights,
          color, etc.). Decided to make a 12 second long animation, somewhat inspired by the Pixar lamp Luxo (important
          note: before making this project, I had never seen the pixar short "Luxo jr.", my only experience with the
          Luxo character had been with the Luxo Pixar title card, all similarities between my work and the short "Luxo
          jr." is purely coincidental),
          challenging myself by attempting to give a normally inanimate object something akin to a character and
          personality.</p>
        <p>Created in Maya 2025, rendered with the Arnold rendering engine. 300 frames, running at 24 frames per second.
          Time spent creating (from opening the project to submitting it): ~3 hours.</p>
