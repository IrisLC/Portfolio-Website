      <p>A FPS, stealth game currently being developed over the course of the Spring 2025 semester for a class in Indie
        Game
        Development. This project blends 2D pixel art and 3D assets to create a unique visual experience for the player.
      </p>

      <p>Working as the Enemy designer and Co-Level Designer among a team of 6.</p>

      <p>This project is allowing me to expand on my work with <a href=./strangeTower.html>Strange Tower</a> to create
        much more complex enemy AI. I have implemented an enemy behavior model based on a Finite State Machine, to allow
        the enemy to respond to the player's actions dynamically. Additionally I have worked on things like dynamic
        sprite billboards, and level wide realistic enemy communication. I have also created tools to create patrol
        routes for enemies that members of my team who are not experienced with code can easily create purely through
        visual elements.</p>

      <p>A store page for this game will be available by the end of May 2025.</p>
