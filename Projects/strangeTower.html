        <p>A first person roguelite/beat'emup project developed over the course of a the Fall 2024 semester for a class
          in Indie Game
          Development.
          Worked as a game designer and as one of two programmers in a team of 5, focusing on programming the enemy
          behaviors as well as debugging interactions between the player and enemies.
          Developed in Unity 2023, and programmed in C#.</p>

        <p>This project served as largely a learning experience, as this was my first experience working with:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Unity's Navmesh</li>
          <li>Setting up/using Github in a team</li>
          <li>developing a game from concept to finished product</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Itch.io page for the game can be found <a
